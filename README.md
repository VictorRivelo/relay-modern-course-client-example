# Create React App + Relay

Based on this https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-relay
and this https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/installation-and-setup.html

This uses babel-plugin-macro to enable babel-plugin-relay without ejecting from CRA

## To generate compiled queries artifacts
```bash
yarn relay 
```

## To run your app
```bash
yarn start
```
